## The world's first confidential, scalable, and cross-chain decentralized exchange

There are two types of exchanges today:  centralized exchanges (CEX) like Binance and Coinbase and decentralized exchanges (DEX) like Kyber and Uniswap. Both of them come with pros and cons.

Incognito DEX is an entirely new type of exchange. Like a DEX, it is fully decentralized.  Unlike a DEX, its users and their trade histories are confidential. Like a CEX, it is  scalable. Unlike a CEX, there is no third-party operator risk; users have full control of their money and private keys.

* **Confidential**. Incognito DEX doesn't  disclose buyers, sellers, and transaction amounts.

* **Scalable**. Incognito DEX leverages Incognito's implementation of full sharding to achieve high-throughput. Incognito's throughput scales linearly by adding more shards, so it can continue to grow to support large transaction volume.

* **Cross-chain liquidity**. Incognito DEX leverages Incognito's bridges to the other blockchains - like Ethereum and Bitcoin - to enable cross-chain trading. So you can trade BTC and ETH privately on Incognito DEX.

* **No order book**.  This unique mechanism of Incognito DEX borrows heavily from Nick Johnson's [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/54l32y/euler_the_simplest_exchange_and_currency/) in 2016, Vitalik Buterin's [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/55m04x/lets_run_onchain_decentralized_exchanges_the_way/) in 2016, Hayden Adam's [Uniswap whitepaper](https://hackmd.io/@477aQ9OrQTCbVR3fq1Qzxg/HJ9jLsfTz) in 2018. The idea is to replace traditional order book with a bonding curve mechanism known as constant product. Uniswap is currently the fasting-growing DEX on Ethereum.

## Swap pToken ⇄ pToken

Use PRV as an intermediary for pToken to pToken swaps.

pToken A → PRV → pToken B
