# Incognito Blockchain: A global, open-source platform of decentralized privacy tokens

## The token economy is here

We now live in a token economy. Everything is being tokenized. Fiats. Gold. Bond. Storage. Computing Power. Digital Art. Collectibles. Buildings. More.

## The biggest threat to the token economy

We believe the biggest problem to this new token economy is the lack of privacy. Current blockchains display all transactions publicly — so anyone can see your balances or track your activity. That's why we work to create solutions that make privacy widely accessible and incredibly simple for anyone, anywhere on earth, to exercise their right to that choice.

We believe you should have a choice.

## Incognito mode for the token economy

If you’re here reading this, you already know how fast crypto assets are changing the way we think about money. For those who value privacy, crypto assets come with a big tradeoff. Transactions are recorded on public ledgers, displaying amounts involved, inscribing virtual identities of their senders and receivers.

Given the choice, we strongly believe that very few people will willingly disclose their crypto financials to the entire world. Incognito offers anyone the option to turn on privacy mode in this new world of cryptonetworks.

## A full-stack approach to decentralized privacy

Incognito embraces a full-stack approach to decentralized privacy. Every layer of the stack
works to deliver a simple, fast and secure end-to-end privacy experience for the new
decentralized web.

- Physical Layer. Incognito’s low cost, efficient and streamlined mining hardware
removes typical barriers to entry. It allows for anyone to become a validator and earn
passive income, paid out in various crypto assets such as BTC and ETH.

- Network Layer. A high-throughput proof-of-stake blockchain, made possible by the
implementation of state sharding with 1 beacon chain and N shard chains.

- Data Layer. Incognito uses zero-knowledge proofs, ring signatures, stealth addresses
and confidential transactions to mask the sender, receiver and transaction amount.

- Application Layer. Incognito is mobile first. The Incognito wallet is a simple and
secure tool for anyone to manage their crypto assets confidentially. Incognito built the
entire Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) stack for mobile from scratch. Send a private
transaction on mobile in seconds.

## Power Incognito: Become a validator

Want to help build the privacy layer of the decentralized web and earn rewards? Validators are essential to the security and robustness of the Incognito blockchain.

Incognito is currently running on the testnet. Block rewards are being paid out in testnet PRV, and will be converted to mainnet PRV at a fixed rate. This October, Incognito will launch [Node Device](https://incognito.org), its own plug-and-play staking hardware. For now, you can get a head start by running a virtual node on your computer, or on a cloud instance such as AWS.

Just follow the instructions here to [Run a Virtual Node](https://incognito.org/validator).

## Use Incognito: Download the wallet

The Incognito mobile wallet allows you to privately store, send and receive all your crypto assets. Turn on privacy for your BTC, ETH, DAI and more.

Every line of Incognito's code is freely available. Anyone can participate, everyone can join, no one can ever restrict or control Incognito. Incognito is and will always be 100% open-source. Get stuck into the code and make the project better, or build your own amazing products and applications on top of Incognito. Developers, how will you use your superpowers?

These instructions will get you up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

- Install [Go](http://golang.org/doc/install)

- Clone this project to your local GOPATH

- Build executable

    ```shell
    go build -o incognito
    ```

- Run an Incognito Node

    ```shell
    ./incognito --enablewallet --wallet "wallet" --walletpassphrase "12345678" --testnet --norpcauth --walletautoinit
    ```
